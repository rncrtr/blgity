Coders seem to frown upon vibe coding.

Non-coders love it.

Sure, there are exceptions on both sides, but the hot takes on both sides of the issue are interesting. Coders seem have some kind of intrinsic hate because they had to grind for the knowledge they have and vibe-coders get to play on the playground without that pain. 

Vibe coders are ready to take their ball and go code because they don't like being gate-kept from having code fun and building apps. 

I sit somewhere in the middle. I'm a coder, and a vibe-coder, but I don't like either view. I'm all for vibe-coders doing new things and the amazing opportunities that it affords everyone. As a coder, I have qualms with this practice, mostly because I don't think it is good for vibe-coders to play in a place where they don't know are dragons. 

Take the recent Tea app leaks. Doxxing 72,000 women which goes exactly opposite your stated goal of protecting women. The thing I haven't heard anyone mention is that both coders and vibe-coders have and will not secure their databases because it is too easy to miss and not fix it when building an app. I mean I haven't done it but I know it is possible. Anyone can do a bad job of security or accidentally expose infromation to the world without trying. Process have holes that no one plugs. Software is dangerous business.

I'd like to see coders and vibe-coders work together somehow. I think the fusion of new ideas and seasoned experience is only good when done right.
