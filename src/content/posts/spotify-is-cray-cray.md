    When future generations ask “who hurt you” I’m gonna have to go with “Spotify”.

Spotify has long been insane. Now they are trying to force ID verification, but a few years ago they were forcing Address verification for family accounts. If a child lived with you they had to verify they lived with you via email every few months or it would KICK THEM OFF THE FAMILY PLAN YOU PAID FOR. 

So I have to manage 4-6 individual emails whenever they decide to bother us to be sure my family can just listen to music? Hell no. It would be easier to get individual accounts and mange them. That makes the family account WORTHLESS. Why? I still don’t know.

So they can’t secure accounts that have good passwords, 2FA, and no dubious access, are only inside my house, because somehow hackers can get into them, but they want to squeeze me to verify things and I am paying them? Nope. We switched to another music service years ago. This is nonsense. 

**ID Verification**? 

*It’s far worse.* 

Treating your customers — paying or not — like criminals (or as “the problem”) instead of like your source of income. Bad business. 

When future generations ask “who hurt you” I’m gonna have to go with “Spotify”. Used to be a good service. Sad.
