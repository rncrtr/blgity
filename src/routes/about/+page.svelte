        He's an employee, father, husband, avid gamer, writer, well known black cat soul,  and LGBTQIA+ ally. 
        He deals with many health issues, including type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, OSA, EDS, Autism, ADHD, and more. 
        He knows what it's like to be tired, in pain, overwhelmed, and still want to make games anyway.
